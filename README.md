## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals.

## Learning Goals

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently.

## Technologies Used  

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* Google

## Set Up and Instructions

To view the code, please go to the GitHub repo (https://github.com/aemiers/whats-for-dinner).

## Functionality
Users are able to generate a randomized side, meal, or dessert by using radio buttons. Once the user has made their selection, an idea will pop up in place of the pot picture on the right hand side of the screen. Once the recipe is generated, users are unable to click on the generate recipe button because it has become deactivated. Upon clicking on the "Clear"
button, users are able to make another serving selection and start the process over.
